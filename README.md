Task 2  done , but I have a problem with Cloudfront, created service request to support:
Your account must be verified before you can add new CloudFront resources. To verify your account, please contact AWS Support (https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/ ) and include this error message.
Because of that have only this link to my site:

but I've done code for automation configuration with cloudfront, build it - you can see my code .

Thank you for your attenyion :)
